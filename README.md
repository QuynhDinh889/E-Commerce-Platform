# E-Commerce-Platform
This project is a small-scale e-commerce system built in Java to practice object-oriented programming principles.

# Features:
- Modelled different product categories (Clothing, Electronics, Food) using inheritance, abstract classes, and enums.
- Implemented product-specific attributes (e.g., clothing type/size, electronics type, food weight/processed flag).
- Designed tax and pricing system: applied GST, PST, and import tariffs where appropriate; included exemptions for non-processed food.
- Built a currency conversion system between CAD, USD, AUD, NZD, GBP, and EUR.
- Added validation to prevent invalid product prices and ensure consistent calculations.
- Developed driver program to instantiate products, track sales, and generate reports with cost totals in Canadian dollars.
